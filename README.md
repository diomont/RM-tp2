# CiberRato Robot Simulation Environment <br/> Universidade de Aveiro / IEETA 

## Information

CiberRato Robot Simulation Environment simulates the movement
of robots inside a labyrinth.  Robots objective is to go from their
starting position to beacon area and then return to their start position.

The MicroRato competition
[http://microrato.ua.pt/], held annually at Aveiro University, 
uses these these tools for its Explorer league.

## Install

The source code was compiled with gcc/g++ - Gnu Project C/C++ Compiler
(gcc version  9.3.0) using the Qt libraries (release 5.12.8) on Ubuntu 20.04.

It is required to have the development version of gcc/g++, cmake, Qt libraries
release 5.x installed in the system prior to compilation.
On Ubuntu 20.04 run the following:
```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake qt5-default qtmultimedia5-dev
```

Then in the repository base dir, execute:
