distance from robot center to line sensor is 0.438
investigate "complementary filter" to use both motionmodel and compass measures for orientation prediction
->
	new_ori = a * ori_motion_model + b * compass_measure
	a + b = 1   # basically give each component a weight

compass measures are in degrees
